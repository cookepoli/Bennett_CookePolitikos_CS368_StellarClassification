Discuss organization of code:
* I like jupyter notebooks: 
    * can narrate the code outside of comments with more formatting  
    * allows for outputs and visualizations (data frames and graphs) to be represented directly under the code
    * followed with analysis 
    * can be dumped to a .py script
        * it will include all of the narrative by default
        * can be told to exclude markdown cells when rendering using the `Jupytext` library 

Discuss best way to communicate
* not email
* some other cross platform app: a team in teams allow us to organize everything in one place
    * Planner has task management board
    * direct messaging is easier to navigate
    * meetings/calendar can be organized there
